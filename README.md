# AutoBots
During software development, there are many tasks that software developers are responsible for. Some of these tasks are really tedious but are necessary to be performed. Developers are responsible for managing their own virtual resources which includes creating virtual machines, installing necessary applications or packages on it and much more. These tasks can take ample amount of the developerâ€™s time which could be used efficiently solving bigger problems. Also, setting up development environments with IDEs such as Eclipse can be a painful task as it involves creation of workspaces, installing required plugins and finally importing all the build projects into the workspace.

AutoBot provides a command based interface (through SLACK) for providing common development setup tasks.It is capable to provide any developer with a development environment (virtual machines on cloud platforms like digital ocean) on which developers will be able to directly start their work with less time spent on waiting. AutoBot can do many tasks varying from creation of a remote Jenkins flavored VM to one with eclipse pre-installed, which developers can run locally. Using Autobot developers could easily manage VMs without making much effort. AutoBot also let developers to terminate or update their reserved instances on cloud by saving all the reservations they has made till date.
